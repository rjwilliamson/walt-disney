Walt Disney wasn't very good at drawing and he wasn't a very good business man. He has been described as cruel perfectionist and many of the Disney films created in his lifetime went obscenely over budget. However, he is a household name the world over and undoubtedly one of the most sucessful and influential men of all time. He embodies the entrepeurial spirit which captures the imagination of many young people today. He is testimony to looking past failures, persisting through difficulties and attempting what everyone else says is impossible. This makes him the perfect candidate for a tribute page by a new developer just starting out.

<h2>"It's kind of fun to do the impossible"</h2>
<h2>"All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them."</h2>
<h2>"We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing new things, because we're curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths."</h2>
<h2>"I only hope that we never lose sight of one thing â€” that it was all started by a mouse."</h2>

<h2>"When you believe in a thing, believe in it all the way, implicitly and unquestionable."</h2>

<h2>"The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing."</h2>

<h2>"You can design and create, and build the most wonderful place in the world. But it takes people to make the dream a reality."</h2>

<h2>"You may not realize it when it happens, but a kick in the teeth may be the best thing in the world for you."</h2>
